<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Tony, an up and coming web designer. I am a bachellor degree holder in Tourism and Hospitality management. My thirst for diversity and global taste has helped cultivate a range of experiences, backgrounds and expertise that bridges disciplines and spans industries—including automotive. </p>
<p>In the last few months, I have made a choice to re-focus into the world of web development. I want to use my expertise to grow in the tech world and affect the world of tech positively in general. I’m a passionate leader of creative teams – both small and at scale - with a design-driven approach and belief in creating meaningful tribes, healthy relationships, disruptive and challenging methodologies and approaches - and an environment that is sensitive and respectful of creative energy, inspiration and health. </p>
